### Project Overview
---
This Project aims to  generate 10 analytical questions which will aid insight generation for Parch and Posey and the SQL queries that  answer these questions 

### Data Sources
 The primary source of Data used here is a csv file of an hypothetical company called Parch and Posey

### Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel for Data Cleaning and Analysis [Download Here](https://www.Microsoft.com)
- SQL- Strutured Query Language for Data Query
- PowerBi for Visualizaion

### Data Cleaning and Preparations
  in the intitial Phase, we performed the following actions;
  - Data Loading and Inspection
  - Handling missing Variables
  - Data Cleaning and Formatting
 
### Exploratory Data Analysis
  This involved Exploring of Data to answer 10 analytical Questions such as;
 1. Which regions have the highest percentage of accounts placing multiple orders?
 2. What is the maximum quantity of poster paper that was ordered by a company?
 3. What sales channel generates the highest order count and total sales
 4. Identify top-performing customers based on total sales within a specific period (Jan 2014-dec 2015)
 5. Which region has made the largest sales
 6. Identify the top 10 customers with the highest total order of papers and the total amount paid?
 7. Which region has the highest count of customers as well as the highest quantity of orders?
 8. Compare the total sales generated by the top 10 sales representative categorizing them by performance
 9. Which channels are driving the most and least traffic to the website, based on the frequency of web events?
 10. Identify total Sales per year on year.

 ### Data Analysis
 This is where we include some basic lines of code or queries or even some of the DAX Expression used during the analysis

 ```SQL
SELECT 
    r.name AS region_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT a.id) AS total_accounts,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN order_counts.order_count > 1 THEN a.id END) AS multiple_order_accounts   
FROM region r
JOIN sales_reps sr ON r.id = sr.region_id
JOIN accounts a ON sr.id = a.sales_rep_id
JOIN (
    SELECT 
        o.account_id, 
        COUNT(o.id) AS order_count
    FROM orders o
    GROUP BY o.account_id
) order_counts ON a.id = order_counts.account_id
GROUP BY r.name
ORDER BY multiple_order_accounts DESC
```
